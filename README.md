## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/karlvbiron/matrix.git

## Usage

M.A.T.R.I.X Help Output:

![Help Output](assets/matrix_help_output.png)

Basic usage:
```
python matrix.py -H <target_ip> -p <port> -a <attack_type>
```

Attack types:
- `read`: Unauthorized read operation
- `coil`: Coil register write attack
- `register`: Holding register write attack
- `overflow`: Register overflow attack
- `dos`: Denial of Service attack
- `replay`: Traffic replay attack
- `spoof`: Response spoofing attack

### Examples

Perform unauthorized read on a local Modbus server:
```
python matrix.py -H localhost -p 502 -a read
```

Launch DoS attack with 50 threads:
```
python matrix.py -H 192.168.1.10 -p 502 -a dos -t 50
```

Replay Modbus traffic from a PCAP file:
```
python matrix.py -H 192.168.1.10 -p 502 -a replay -f captured_traffic.pcap
```

Spoof Modbus responses:
```
python matrix.py -H 192.168.1.10 -p 502 -a spoof -s 192.168.1.20 -i docker0
```

## Architecture

The M.A.T.R.I.X tool is designed with a modular architecture that separates the command-line interface from the individual attack modules. This section provides insights into the tool's structure through class diagrams, package organization, and attack workflow visualization.

### Class Diagram

![Class Diagram](assets/matrix_class_diagram.png)

The class diagram illustrates the object-oriented architecture of M.A.T.R.I.X:

- **MatrixCLI**: The central command-line interface class that processes user arguments and orchestrates the execution of attack modules.
  - Contains methods for parsing arguments, displaying help information, and initializing attack modules.
  - Manages the execution flow and reporting of results.

- **Attack Modules**: Each specialized attack functionality is encapsulated in its own class:
  - **ModbusUnauthorizedReader**: Implements functions for scanning and reading values from Modbus registers and coils without authorization.
  - **ModbusUnauthorizedCoilWriter**: Contains methods for unauthorized manipulation of coil states.
  - **ModbusUnauthorizedHoldingRegisterWriter**: Handles unauthorized writing to holding registers.
  - **ModbusOverflowAttacker**: Implements methods to test for integer overflow vulnerabilities in Modbus implementations.
  - **ModbusReplayAttacker**: Provides functionality to capture, analyze, and replay Modbus traffic for attack simulation.
  - **ModbusResponseSpoofer**: Implements methods to craft and send falsified Modbus responses.
  - **ModbusDosAttacker**: Contains methods for executing denial-of-service attacks through connection flooding.

Each attack module inherits common attributes like host IP, port, and ModbusTcpClient instances, while implementing unique attack functionality through specialized methods.

### Package Structure

![Package Structure](assets/matrix_package_diagram.png)

The package organization of M.A.T.R.I.X follows a logical structure:

- **The M.A.T.R.I.X Project** (Yellow container): The overall project boundary.
  - **matrix.py**: The main CLI interface file that serves as the entry point for the tool.
  - **README.md**: Documentation for the project.
  - **requirements.txt**: Lists the project dependencies.

- **The 'attacks' Folder** (Orange container): Contains all attack module implementations.
  - **__init__.py**: Package initialization file that enables importing from the attacks package.
  - **Individual attack modules**: Seven Python files implementing specific attack functionalities.

- **External Dependencies** (Blue container): Shows the third-party libraries required by the project.
  - **pymodbus**: Primary library for Modbus protocol implementation.
  - **scapy**: Used for packet manipulation in spoofing and replay attacks.
  - **tabulate**: Provides formatted table output for better readability of results.

The arrows between components represent import relationships, showing how the modules connect and depend on each other.

### Attack Workflows

![Attack Workflows](assets/matrix_workflow_diagram.png)

The workflow diagram outlines the execution process for each attack type:

- **Unauthorized Read Attack**: 
  - Connects to the target Modbus server
  - Sequentially reads values from coils, discrete inputs, holding registers, and input registers
  - Reports the discovered information

- **Unauthorized Coils/Registers Write Attack**:
  - Establishes a connection to the target
  - Writes unauthorized values to coils or registers
  - Reads back the changed values to verify the attack was successful
  - Confirms changes were applied to the target system

- **DoS Attack**:
  - Initializes multiple threads for concurrent connections
  - Creates numerous connections to the target
  - Floods the server with Modbus requests
  - Continuously monitors target response to determine impact

- **Replay Attack**:
  - Loads captured Modbus traffic from a PCAP file
  - Extracts and analyzes Modbus packet structures
  - Replays captured request packets to the target
  - Compares original and new responses to identify discrepancies

- **Spoof Attack**:
  - Crafts custom Modbus responses with falsified data
  - Sets the source address to match a legitimate Modbus server
  - Sends the spoofed packets to the target
  - Observes system behavior to assess impact

All attack workflows conclude with a comprehensive results report.

### Implementation Notes

The modular design allows for:
- Easy extension with new attack modules
- Independent testing and development of individual attack types
- Consistent interface across different attack functionalities
- Simplified maintenance and updates
